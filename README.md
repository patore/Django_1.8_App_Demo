This is a full Django Web App written in Django 1.8.10 and Python3.5
Other Technologies used are Bootstrap3 for the Client. Postgres for the database and packages in requirements.txt

Some improvements coming soon are:
- Better code comments
- Tests for codebase (was not following TDD)
- Decouple API and create keys( helpful at scale)
